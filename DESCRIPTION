Description: timeOmics is a generic data-driven framework to integrate 
  multi-Omics longitudinal data measured on the same biological samples and select 
  key temporal features with strong associations within the same sample group.
  The main steps of timeOmics are: 
    1. Plaform and time-specific normalization and filtering steps;
    2. Modelling each biological into one time expression profile;
    3. Clustering features with the same expression profile over time;
    4. Post-hoc validation step.
